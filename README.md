# Java-to-SQL
This is a basic implementation of Java to SQL for a database of movies

I will be implementing this with a local instance of mySQL, connected to a Java database management system using JDBC.
This requires a mySQL server instance, you can use the dump file I have included to set up your program, simply run
source dump.sql
from within mysql.
